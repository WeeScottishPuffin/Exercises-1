    <p>This website is still under construction; I am planning to improve the css in the near future.</p>
    <ul>
        <h4>Day 1</h4>
        <li><a href="Exercise-1/main.html">Exercise 1</a>: <i>An old aboutme page.</i></li>
        <p>I was given an image to recreate in <b>html/css/javascript</b> and no further restrictions. This was my first exercise and also by far the easiest.</p>
        <li><a href="Exercise-3/main.html">Exercise 3</a>: <i>A non-responsive (and non-resizable) recreation of a webpage.</i></li>
        <p>I was again, given an image to recreate. This exercise was still easy, but a slight step up in complexity from <b>Exercise 1</b>. They didn't require resizability or responsiveness.</p>
        <h4>Day 2</h4>
        <li><a href="Exercise-5/main.html">Exercise 5</a>: <i>A simple password generator.</i></li>
        <p>During this exercise, I was given both an image and some requirements. It took a bit more time than either of the first 4 exercises, but I was able to complete it with easy. I added a few functions that weren't originally required; a copy button and the 'animation' of the text.</p>
        <h4>Day 3</h4>
        <li><a href="Exercise-6/main.html">Exercise 6</a>: <i>An elevator panel</i></li>
        <p>I was given some requirements and free reign to create an elevator panel in <b>html/css/javascript</b>. It was still quite easy, but certainly more complicated than any of the previous exercises. I also added some music and sound effects, both of which weren't required.</p>
        <li><a href="Exercise-7/main.html">Exercise 7</a>: <i>An alarm webapp.</i></li>
        <p>I was required to make a simple alarm system in <b>html/css/javascript</b>. I made this on the last day of my internship, and hadn't the time to really polish it. I still managed to create a working product without too much of a challenge.</p>
    </ul>
